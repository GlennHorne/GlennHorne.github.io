		<h2 style="color:blue;">About Me</h1>
		<div style="text-indent:50px;">
			<p style="color:blue";>I come from a country town in Victoria, Australia. Over the years, I have lived in Melbourne, Canberra, and Sydney. I hold a Diploma in Financial Services (Financial Planning), and I am currently studying for my Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT. I am currently learning the electric guitar.

		<h2 style="color:blue;">Interest in IT</h1>
		<div style="text-indent:50px;">
			<p style="color:blue;">My interest in IT lies mainly in the field of programming, in which I first became interested at an early age. My middle name, Desmond, was chosen for me by my parents at the time of my birth because they were friends with a couple, the male partner of which called himself Desmond and who just happened to work in the field of IT. Whether this has any relevance to my now studying IT, I can’t say, but it seems at the very least to be a delightful coincidence! To this day I do not have any professional IT experience, apart from my having worked with computers and so forth as part of my duties as an office administrator.
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">I chose to come to RMIT because I need to earn a qualification in information technology should I wish to pursue my current desire to work in this particular field. The course I am undertaking with RMIT seems an entirely appropriate choice for this, as its basic structure covers all aspects of IT that I need to learn, and, in addition, offers minors and electives in which I may find myself interested.
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">During my studies, I expect to learn - at first - foundational knowledge and skills and, later, core knowledge and skills followed by more special skills and knowledge as time goes by. I trust that, by the time I complete my degree, I will have learned all that I require to move into a job to my liking.

		</a>
		<div style="text-indent:50px;">
			<p style="color:blue;">It seems one of the responsibilities of the job I have chosen is the design of computing products through the development of software. Other aspects of the job which are of appeal to me are the opportunity to work for a global brand, the flexibility to work from the office or the home, and the opportunity to work with the latest technology. 
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">Wide skills in various programming languages seem to be required for the job in question. With regard to the qualifications required for the job in question, I presume an undergraduate degree in information technology or higher is required. Experience in serverless computing and with big data seem also to be required.
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">IT skills I currently have related to those required for the job in question include a basic grasp of some of the foundational introductory-level concepts involved in the use of C and Python. I do not currently hold any IT-related qualifications, and I do not currently have any IT-related professional experience.
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">With regard to how I will obtain the necessary skills, qualifications, and experience required for this job, the bachelor degree I am currently undertaking will perhaps suffice - if and when successfully completed. However, the notable inclusions of programming electives and the completion of a minor in internet design should perhaps be added.

		<h2 style="color:blue;">Personal Profile</h1>
		<div style="text-indent:50px;">
			<p style="color:blue;">With regard to my results for the online Myers-Briggs test that I did, the personality traits tested for and that determine how one interacts with one’s environment and how one makes decisions and copes with one’s emotions indicated that I am of the extraverted-feeling type. My results for the Big Five Personality test that I did perhaps reinforce this notion. For the online learning test that I did, my indicated learning style is auditory 40%, visual 40%, and tactile 20%.
			</p>
			<p style="color:blue;">My results of the online learning test perhaps suggest that I am a well-balanced individual when it comes to learning. Being of the extraverted-feeling type perhaps incurs the responsibility to mobilize a group and activate its store of ideas. This mode of conducting business naturally involves the taking of responsibility for one’s own actions and thoughts such that the group’s participation and work in general is kept progressing. When forming a team, I suppose I will have to be mindful of the group’s needs and open to the ideas of others.

	<h1 style="color:blue;">Project Idea</h1>
	<article style="background-color:white;">
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Overview</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">My proposed project is an animated adventure in which Loener, an erudite student, makes his way through a memory palace that has been specifically designed for the learning of 50 English verbs. The target group of the project is Australian adults who may have a problem with English literacy and with problem solving in technology-rich environments. The project will develop basic interactive skills using either a desktop or laptop computer and at the same time develop the user’s literacy capacity. The project is essentially a computer-based programme, and it is not intended for distribution as an app for other devices.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Motivation</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">Some 12.6% of adults in Australia attain only Level 1 or below in literacy proficiency. That is, these adults can read brief texts on familiar topics and locate a single piece of specific information identical in form to information in the question or directive. Some 38.1% score at or below Level 1 in problem solving in technology rich environments, i.e. these adults can only use widely available and familiar technology applications to solve basic problems involving few steps, simple reasoning and little or no navigation across applications (www.oecd.org, 2013). Therefore, this project will be useful in addressing both of the above problems.
	</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">www.oecd.org. (2013). OECD Skills Surveys. [online] Available at: https://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/Country%20note%20-%20Australia_final.pdf [Accessed 6 Dec. 2019].
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Description</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">It is proposed that initially the usage of 50 common English verbs will be explored. Later developments could include less common verbs, and thus the programme could mirror the style of old-school computer and video games in that it would have easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels.
	</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">To this end, the character, Loener, as he makes his way through the memory palace, will stop at specific locations and perform an action demonstrating the use of the verb to be explored. The user will be prompted to answer the question, “Where is Loener and what is he doing?”, and thus the user will be called upon to recall from memory the word describing what the action may be that is associated with the animation on the computer screen in front of her or him.
	</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">An alternative approach to the course of events could involve Loener simply stop at the appropriate location and not perform any action at all. The user would in this approach be presented with the image of a playing card from a standard deck of cards and be prompted to recall to memory a verb assigned to that card. This approach would involve the Major method of constructing a word for memorization. The Major method involves the use of 10 distinct sounds that are associated with the numbers zero to nine. The sound “ta” or “da” is associated with the number one. Utilizing another method, the suits of a deck of cards are assigned the following numbers: 
	</p>
	<ul style="color:blue;">
	<li>Spades 11 – 23</li>
	<li>Diamonds 31 – 43</li>
	<li>Clubs 51 – 63</li>
	<li>Hearts 81 - 93</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="color:blue;">Therefore, combining the two methods, the number representing the ace of spades is 11, and an example of the associated sound would be “ta-ta”, “ta-da”, “da-ta”, or “da-da”. A word made up of these sounds could be “tidy” and thus Loener could be at the sublocation, “shelves”, of the “walk-in robe” of the memory palace tidying his clothes. Therefore, in response to the question, “Where is Loener and what is he doing?”, the user would enter, “He is in the walk-in robe, tidying his clothes”.
	</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">Other features could include the option to create a memory palace of one’s own, such as the current or a former residence of the user, and the ability to programme Loener to stop at the location desired where a card could also be placed. (Re-animation of Loener would perhaps be, at this stage of development of the programme, a little too difficult to introduce.) The memory palace could perhaps be even entirely of the user’s imagination!
	</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">The default memory palace would be that of a two-story townhouse with eleven rooms and sub-locations within these rooms at which Loener will stop. The sublocations would be similar to the example given above, i.e. the shelves of the walk-in robe. The number of words, 50, has been chosen because there are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards, and this would suffice for the programme’s purpose.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Tools and Technologies</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">Software that may be needed may include Java Development Kit 8 for the compilation and running of the code. Hardware that may be needed may include a PC or Mac. If using a Mac, Automator may be needed to convert the fileName.jar file to a fileName.app file. For development of the software, the use of an IDE, such as Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, may be advisable. For initial modelling of the memory palace, either of the open source tools LibreCAD or FreeCAD may be useful, perhaps depending upon whether the palace will be in two dimensions or three dimensions.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Skills Required</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">The project may require the following skills:
	</p>
	<ul style="color:blue;">
	<li>Java programming skills in general, and Java GUI programming skills in particular</li>
	<li>Knowledge of how to convert a fileName.jar file into a fileName.app file</li>
	<li>Knowledge of how to adapt the programme for other platforms would be a bonus</li>
	</ul>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Special Hardware Required</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">No special hardware is required. A working PC or Mac is all that is required.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Other Practical Considerations</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">If the project is to be completed on time, one may need to have already developed the necessary programming skills. The software required requires no cost and is, in the main, freely available over the internet.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue;">Outcome</h1>
	<p style="color:blue;">If this project is successful, it may mean that the Australian adult population takes one more step – a drop in the ocean, as it were - towards full literacy and developed problem solving skills in technology-rich environments. The problem of Australian-adult proficiency in these areas may persist, but it is hoped that this project may make adult learning somewhat more enjoyable, and thus perhaps develop interest in these two key information-processing skills. Its impact remains to be seen, for any impact in these areas may take time to percolate into quantifiable results, such as those that can be statistically verified.
